# The Virtual Grid System (VGS) : <br> Distributed Simulation of Distributed Systems 
This software was developed and released by P.S. Tekieli and I.V. Ivanov as a part of IN4391 (Distributed Computing Systems (2015-2016 Q3)) course's final assignment. The learning objectives associated with this laboratory task were aimed to show students how complex the operations performed by cloud infrastructures are, and what tradeoffs are usually involved in the design of distrubted platforms' applications. In order to do so, the team was asked to create, implement and test a Virtual Grid Simulator that would demonstrate the feasibility of emuluted multi-cluster system, and reveal the most recent problems with providing decent levels of fault-tolerance, scalability and replication inside those structures. This particular application is capable of utlizing DAS-4 supercomputer resources for achieving the aforementioned goals and can automatically be deployed within this cluster with the use of included Testing Environment Controller (TEC).
